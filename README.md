# Tangentratesmethod
This code is a tangents method that is used to determine the tariff prices of electricity. The user is asked to input the number of tangents to be used for the approximation, either two or three. A third-order polynomial equation of the curve is then defined, and a graph of the curve is plotted. The area under the curve is also calculated, and the derivative of the curve is obtained to obtain all the tangents. In the case of two tangents, the error between pairs of tangents and the area of the curve is calculated, and the best pair of tangents is located. For three tangents, the same procedure is used to locate the best combination of tangents. Finally, the results of the calculations are printed, including the best combination of tangents, their intersection points, and tariff ranges.
